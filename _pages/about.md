Hello, I'm Namkyeong Lee.
I'm a Ph.D. student in the Industrial and Systems Department at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I am currently working as a visiting scholar at UIUC, under the guidance of [Prof. Jimeng Sun](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/jimeng)
I'm also actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

Nowadays, AI is revolutionizing practices across multiple sectors. 
My interest lies in leveraging AI's potential to assimilate and utilize the vast expanse of human knowledge in different scientific disciplines, particularly in the areas of materials science and biochemistry.

<!-- Nowadays, the amount of data that is generated every minute in the world makes it challenging to locate the values we require.
Therefore, it is essential to automatically extract knowledge from real-world data and create AI solutions for a variety of real-world applications from many disciplines. -->
