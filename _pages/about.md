Hi, I'm Namkyeong Lee. I am currently with Genentech as a Senior Machine Learning Scientist.

I recently earned my Ph.D. from the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at KAIST, advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/) at the [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (DSAIL)](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/). My doctoral research, deeply rooted in the collaboration with the Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT), focused on bridging the gap between AI and molecular science.

Nowadays, AI is revolutionizing practices across multiple domains. 
My interest lies in leveraging AI's potential to assimilate and utilize the vast expanse of human knowledge in different scientific disciplines, particularly in the areas of biochemistry and drug discovery, ultimately benefiting human society.

My research topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for scientific discovery
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific discovery
- LLM Agent Systems for scientific discovery
