Hello, I'm Namkyeong Lee.
I'm a master's degree student in the Industrial and Systems Department at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research interest is mainly on anything connected to or can be represented as graphs!
- Graph Representation Learning (Self- / Semi-Supervised Learning on Graphs)
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Chemistry and Biology
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Recommendation

Our world is a set of infinite connectivities, the graph structure is a natural way to express our world.
