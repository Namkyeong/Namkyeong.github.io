Hi I'm Sukwon Yun! ðŸ‘‹

Currently, I'm a master's degree candidate for Industrial & System Engineering at KAIST (Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology),
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best teamates at [DSAIL@KAIST](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research interest mainly lies on `Weakness of Graph Neural Networks`  

- Long-Tailedness (Everything, literally *everything* is long-tailed!)
- Oversmoothing (Is 2 or 3 layers enough?)
- Heterophily (Real world graphs do not always follow homophily assumptions!)
