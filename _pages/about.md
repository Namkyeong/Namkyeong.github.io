Hello, I'm Namkyeong Lee.
I'm a Ph.D. candidate in the Industrial and Systems Department at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).
I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

During my doctoral studies, I closely worked with the [Korea Research Institute of Chemical Technology (KRICT)](https://www.krict.re.kr/eng/), collaborating on various projects in the field. Additionally, I worked as a research intern at [Naver Corporation](https://www.navercorp.com/) and [Genentech](https://www.gene.com/), and also held the position of visiting scholar at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I was mentored by [Prof. Jimeng Sun](http://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/faculty/jimeng).

Nowadays, AI is revolutionizing practices across multiple domains. 
My interest lies in leveraging AI's potential to assimilate and utilize the vast expanse of human knowledge in different scientific disciplines, particularly in the areas of biochemistry and drug discovery, ultimately benefiting human society.

My research topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for scientific discovery
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for scientific discovery
- LLM Agent Systems for scientific discovery
