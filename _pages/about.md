Hi I'm Yunhak Oh! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a current master's degree candidate for Industrial & System Engineering at Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST),
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research interest is mainly on anything connected to or can be represented as graphs!

- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
- Continual Learning
- Neural ODEs
- General Machine Learning and Data Mining
