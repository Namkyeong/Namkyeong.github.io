Hello, I'm Namkyeong Lee.
I'm a Ph.D. student in the Industrial and Systems Department at KAIST,
where I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Chanyoung Park](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/professor/).

I'm actively on research with my best colleagues at [Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://dsail.kaist.ac.kr/).

Nowadays, the amount of data that is generated every minute in the world makes it challenging to locate the values we require.
Therefore, it is essential to automatically extract knowledge from real-world data and create AI solutions for a variety of real-world applications from many disciplines.

Among the various data structures, I'm mainly interested in a graph structure, which is simple yet effective to represent complex relationships in reality.

- Graph Representation Learning (Self- / Semi-Supervised Learning on Graphs)
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Chemistry and Biology
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for Recommendation
- Anything connected to or can be represented as graphs!
